The reason we test is to assertain if the code behaves as we expect.

We use tests so that if other developers change our code, the tests will fail.

First test for the expected datatypes.

An assertion is something that checks whether the actual result is the same as expected result. E.g. Expected a String, Given a String.

Write tests that are supposed to throw errors.
